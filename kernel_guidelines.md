Kernel Guidelines:

The following aren't allowed to be added into kernel sources:


Overclocking of kernel

Magisk/App Blocker without the need to block toxic modules like FDE.AI. Blocking TikTok/any similar app isn't allowed either.

Boeffla Wakelock Blocker. Wakelocks exists for a reason. The removal of those that are harmful for the device is allowed.



Prefer giving users fewer switches to tinker.
