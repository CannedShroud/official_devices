Kernel Guidelines:

The following aren't allowed to be added into kernel sources:
Overclocking of kernel

Magisk/App Blocker without the need to block toxic modules like FDE.AI. Blocking TikTok/any similar app isn't allowed either.

Boeffla Wakelock Blocker. Wakelocks exists for a reason. The removal of those that are harmful for the device is allowed.

Scheduler restrictions don't apply. However, that doesn't mean we don't look/care about all the possible crappy schedulers you pushed. The same applies to I/O, TCP Schedulers (Backports don't apply to restrictions).

Prefer giving users fewer switches to tinker.
